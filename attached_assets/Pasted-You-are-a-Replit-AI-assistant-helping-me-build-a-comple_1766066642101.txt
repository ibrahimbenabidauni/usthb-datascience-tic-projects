You are a Replit AI assistant helping me build a **complete student project management platform** called "TIC Projects Platform".  

I want you to **create a working MVP** with the following specifications:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Node.js + Express backend
   - Serve static frontend files from /public
   - Enable CORS and JSON parsing
   - Include a package.json with correct dependencies
   - Make sure the server starts without errors

2. **Database**
   - Use a simple database (SQLite preferred for Replit) to store:
     - Users (id, username, email, password hash)
     - Projects (id, title, description, author_id)
     - Optional: Reviews table (student reviews per project)
   - Implement proper table creation/migration on first run

3. **Authentication**
   - /auth/register: allow students to register
   - /auth/login: allow students to login
   - Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
   - Use JWT for session/token management
   - Validate input (no empty usernames/passwords)

4. **Frontend Pages (Responsive & Modern)**
   - **Home Page** (/index.html)
     - Explain the idea of the website
     - Link to Projects page and Login/Register pages
     - Modern, clean design with cards, buttons, hover effects
   - **Projects Page** (/projects.html)
     - List all submitted projects from database
     - Allow logged-in students to submit new projects via a form
     - Display project title, description, and author
   - **Login Page** (/login.html)
     - Form to login (username/email + password)
   - **Register Page** (/register.html)
     - Form to register a new student

5. **Backend Routes**
   - /projects (GET): return all projects
   - /projects (POST): allow authenticated users to submit a project
   - /auth/register and /auth/login as described above
   - Optional: /reviews (POST/GET) if time allows

6. **Extras / Helpful Features**
   - Show proper success/error messages on frontend forms
   - Protect project submission so only logged-in users can submit
   - Include a logout button that clears JWT
   - Make frontend fully responsive and user-friendly
   - Minimal styling using CSS (no frameworks required, optional Bootstrap if needed)
   - Use environment variables for JWT secret

7. **Final Output**
   - Corrected package.json with all dependencies
   - index.js fully functional server
   - routes/auth.js with working register/login
   - routes/projects.js with working project CRUD
   - public/index.html, projects.html, login.html, register.html
   - Any database initialization scripts
   - Ready to run in Replit without errors

**Important:**  
Do not skip any step. Make everything **fully functional**, even if it’s a simple MVP. Make it **look like a real student project platform**. Include comments in the code to explain key parts.
