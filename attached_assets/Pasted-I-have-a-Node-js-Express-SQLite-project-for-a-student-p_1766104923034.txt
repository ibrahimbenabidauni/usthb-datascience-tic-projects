I have a Node.js + Express + SQLite project for a student project platform. Currently, the website crashes on Vercel with a 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR because SQLite cannot write to files in a serverless environment. I need you to:

1. **Fix the backend for serverless**:
   - Make SQLite work safely on Vercel (e.g., use /tmp or suggest a cloud DB solution).
   - Wrap all endpoints in try/catch to prevent crashes.
   - Ensure authentication, project submission, and search users continue to work without errors.

2. **Project table features**:
   - Add **Edit** and **Delete** buttons for users’ own projects.
   - Changes should update dynamically in the table without page reload.
   - Include proper validation so users cannot edit/delete other users’ projects.

3. **Full, rich animations everywhere** (“animaaaaation”):
   - Floating, bouncing, pulsing, rotating, scaling elements.
   - Animated gradients and shimmering backgrounds.
   - Star rating system with dynamic filling animations and small particle effects.
   - Animated modal pop-ins and closings.
   - Interactive hover effects on buttons, cards, project badges, and icons.
   - Parallax scrolling or layered movement for page sections.
   - Smooth transitions for adding, editing, or deleting projects.
   - Skeleton loaders or animated placeholders for asynchronous content.

4. **Frontend polish**:
   - Maintain modern responsive design.
   - Use gradients, shadows, rounded corners, and smooth transitions consistently.
   - Keep forms, search results, and user profile interactions intuitive and animated.

5. **Keep all existing features functional**:
   - Auth (login/register)
   - Profile picture upload
   - Searching users by username
   - Project submission

6. Provide **fully functional code snippets** for backend and frontend, with comments explaining:
   - Where the serverless fixes were applied
   - How animations were added
   - How edit/delete functionality works

Focus **first on fixing the Vercel crash**, then implement **edit/delete features**, and finally **add rich, lively animations throughout the website**.
